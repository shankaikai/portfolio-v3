          Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr
          themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
          development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of
          building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge
          corporation, and a digital product studio.

          My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for
          our customers at Klaviyo. I most enjoy building software in the sweet
          spot where design and engineering meet — things that look good but are
          also built well under the hood. In my free time, I've also released an
          online video course that covers everything you need to know to build a
          web app with the Spotify API.

          When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading,
          hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule
          searching for Korok seeds K o r o k s e e d s .
